# awesome-tcjj
Ideastorming for awesome-tcjj initiatives and projects. The goal of this repository is to be a place for ideas for various awesome projects that tcjj will eventually encompass.

First commit, the github automattic commit on setup of the project, the readme and the license was established.

Until further notice or change, the license shall be MIT based, vs Apache or GPL. In someways, I'm going with the flow (circa 2015). Rather than going GPL, it seems many new projects (e.g. Android, jQuery, etc) are choosing licenses such as Apache or MIT.

Upon second committer adding content, it shall be flexible, I, Jonathan Lai, may change MIT to something else. But upon the second commiter (via git), the license shall be fully determined based on a discussion of the various license options.
